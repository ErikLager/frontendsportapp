# SPORTAPP
This is my schoolproject of a sportapp with a table. 

**DISCALMER: THIS WILL NOT WORK IF YOU DON'T USE A BACKEND WITH XAMPP AND A BACKEND WRITTEN IN NETBEANS.**

## Content (Required files):
* Index.js
* appdata.js
* sport.js
* matcheditor.js
* sport.css (only required for styling)

## Backend:
You will need a backend (I wrote it in java) with the adress "http://localhost:8080/sportApp/api/match"(You can test this with ARC(Advanced Rest Client)). 

## Booting
To get the page to load you need to download npm. That is possible in the console in Visual Studio Code. Head to the correct folder "cd {insert foldername}" and to head back you type "cd..". When you are in the correct folder type "npm install" and accept all.
